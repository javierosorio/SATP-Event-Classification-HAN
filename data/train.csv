False,"In what constitutes undeniable evidence of Pakistan s involvement in the terror attack at Dinanagar in Gurdaspur District of Punjab on July 27, the intelligence agencies have found that the Global Positioning System (GPS) sets recovered from the slain terrorists were first fed with data on July 21 at Sargodha in the Punjab Province of Pakistan, reports The Times of India. The examination of GPS sets also shows that the three terrorists were sent with instructions to kill the District Magistrate (DM) and the Superintendent of Police (SP) of Gurdaspur, attack the Dinanagar Police station and inflict mass casualties by blowing up passenger trains. Top Government sources described the data retrieved from the GPS sets as incontrovertible technical evidence of Pakistan s complicity , and expressed confidence that investigators would soon be able to determine the identity of the three attackers. The report said the GPS data shows that the masterminds had set three targets for the terrorists. The first was the Dinanagar Pathankot rail track on which five bombs were found strapped. Dinanagar Police station, where the encounter took place resulting in the terrorists being killed, was the second on the hit list. The terrorists were expected to eventually proceed to the high profile targets of bungalows of the DM and the SP in the Civil Lines area of the town for what could have been a deadly climax. Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) has emerged as the prime suspect behind July 27 terror attack in Gurdaspur in Punjab, adds The Times of India. The modus operandi was reminiscent of the storming of police stations in Jammu and Kashmir (J K), particularly the March attack carried out by LeT in Samba, while the equipment found on the three fidayeen such as GPS device, AK 47s and Chinese grenades, as well as a conscious effort on their part to conceal their identity bore the unmistakable stamp of a Lashkar operation. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) s initial assessment is that the terrorists may have infiltrated from across Pakistan into Kathua, which borders Dinanagar, the site of the attack. It is likely that they were headed for a fidayeen operation in Jammu region, but given the tight security there in the wake of intelligence inputs on LeT s plans to push in two groups of infiltrators into Kathua, they may have found it easier to target an adjoining location in Punjab, a senior Home Ministry official said. The modus operandi terrorists dressed in military fatigues, early morning strike, car jacking, indiscriminate firing and storming of a police station followed by engaging security forces in an encounter had all the elements associated with a typical LeT attack, the official added. UMHA on July 28 claimed that the attack led by three terrorists at Dinanagar Police station in Gurdaspur was a desperate bid by Pakistan s intelligence agency, Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) to revive militancy in Punjab, reports Mumbai Mirror. Last week Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) and Chief Secretary were called for a meeting to apprise them of intelligence reports that ISI is making all possible efforts to regroup separatist forces within the state. The Khalistan movement is all but over. Our reports suggested that ISI was making all possible efforts to cajole few remnant separatists but found no support. Their request for logistic support for their men was also not heard. Which is why we believe they sent three fidayeen, a senior MHA official said."

False,"Individuals and institutions in Saudi Arabia are pumping in millions of rupees into India to open religious trusts and Non Governmental Organisations, reveal the diplomatic documents released by WikiLeaks, Sunday Guardian reports on June 27. Officials with the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) have termed this as an attempt to help spread and propagate Wahhabism in the country . An undated document, which according to WikiLeaks, originated from the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in New Delhi, contains the list of Indian institutions and societies that have applied for financial assistance. The document suggests that the government of Saudi Arabia itself pledged donations to nine such institutions located across different states, including Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Kerala and Maharashtra. Saudi Arabia pledged 2.5 million Saudi Riyal (SR) to Islamic Mission Trust, Malpurram (Mallapuram) in Kerala, which is registered with the UMHA, ostensibly for constructing an arts and science college building. Similarly, it also pledged 1 million SR to the Kerala branch of Islamic Welfare Trust for constructing a nursing college. A similar amount was also pledged to the Palghat Mujahideen Arabic College Committee in Kerala for the purpose of extending an existing medical college and the Karuma hospital building.

According to officials, India s Shia population is the world s second largest after Iran. To counter the increasing Shia influence, a certain section in the Saudi establishment has been propagating Wahhabism in India, says an UMHA official."

Like the previous years, some incidents of infiltration have taken place but the number of attempts has definitely come down, said General Hasnain. He said that some incidents of infiltration have remained un reported adding that the infiltration attempts made in strategically important areas get coverage in the media. Usually the infiltration that takes place in the Uri sector gets media coverage while as occurrence of such incidents at other places do not find a place in media. We established contact with militants at some other places and even yesterday an infiltration attempt was foiled. He said that infiltration usually takes place in April and May adding that this year 2012 as the winter has been prolonged the attempts of infiltration may take place in June as well. He said Sopore, Baramulla, Kupwara and other areas of North Kashmir have direct impact of the infiltration attempts since they fall in vicinity of the Line of Control (LoC). Hasnain said that 300 militants are operating in the Kashmir Valley and that most of them are operating in North Kashmir. He also said that militants are trying to regroup in South Kashmir especially in Pulwama District. We have reduced the night patrolling in the areas of South Kashmir and this may be the reason that militancy has been revived to some extent in South Kashmir especially in the Pulwama district. We are working in collaboration with Jammu and Kashmir Police and over the next two weeks we would be able to wipe militants who have come up yet again, said Hasnain. He further said that militants have changed their strategy and they are using cars for planting bombs. He said the car bomb blast at Bijbehara along with the recovery of explosives laden car from Chanapora area in Srinagar are significant reminders about this development on the militant front. There are enough explosives with the militants operating in the Kashmir valley although the weaponry is less. It is quite possible that the militants may strengthen their ranks in Kashmir in the months to come. As such it is important to notice their movements and take steps that would defeat their designs, said Hasnain."

The demonstration, which was attended by about 1,000 people, was HuT’s last reported activity in India, said the report prepared by Surinder Kumar Sharma, who is associated with Delhi based Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA)."

In his book ‘Choices Inside the Making of India’s Foreign Policy’, Menon says that this estimate does not include the “opportunity cost” to Sri Lanka which was once the fastest growing and the most open economy in South Asia. About deaths, the veteran Indian diplomat turned security expert says that between 1983 and 2009, 80,000 to 100,000 people, including combatants from both sides, lost their lives. Among them were 30,000 to 50,000 civilians, 27,693 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) cadres, 23,790 Sri Lankan Army personnel, and 1,155 men of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF).The final stages of the war had created a little over 300,000 refugees or Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). The war had also left 1.6 million land mines in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. But the real casualty of the war was Sri Lanka’s composite society, something that the LTTE and Sinhala chauvinism are “equally responsible for”, Menon says. “Sri Lanka’s democracy was flawed by disappearances, killings, torture, detention, and widespread human rights abuses committed by all sides in the war. Civil military relations were skewed, Sinhala society was militarized, and the brutalized remnants of Tamil civil society were leaderless, without direction or hope. Nor was there any sign of an attempt to come to terms with the legacy and result of the war, to undertake real reconciliation,” he observes grimly. Menon points out that LTTE ‘chief’ Prabhakaran had left his Sri Lankan Tamil community “gutted and brutalized” by his war."

Pakistan s intelligence agency ISI, which oversees the mint, uses organised networks including those run by its clients like Dawood Ibrahim, Lashkar e Taiba (LeT), besides international criminal networks to push fake currency into India.In a report to Government and RBI, intelligence agencies had claimed a few years ago that Pakistan machinery had achieved zero error counterfeit capability in printing fake Indian notes. According to an estimate, INR 70 crore worth FICN is pushed every year by Pakistan into the Indian economy, which was used as terror fund and to spearhead disturbances."
False,"A key accused in the Bengaluru serial blasts of July 25, 2008, K P Sabeeralias Mohammed SabeeraliasAyub is living in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Pakistan,investigations by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Kerala Police have revealed, Indian Express reports on May 30. Sabeer, allegedly linked to the Lashkar e Taiba (LeT), had fallen off the radar of investigating agencies after fleeing India on a fake passport in November 2008. He was also the former president of Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) in Kerala.His whereabouts have reportedly emerged now following investigations around K A Anoop, an alleged associate of Sabeer who was deported from the UAE in April, 2016. The NIA had arrested Anoop on April 8, 2016, after he was detained on his arrival at IGI Airport, New Delhi in connection with the September 2005 Kalamassery (Kochi) bus burning case. Sources familiar with the investigations claimed the two were in touch and that analysis of Anoop’s Dubai phone call records has revealed a number linked to Sabeer. “He has been trying to take his wife to Pakistan and has been offering 100,000 dirhams to obtain travel documents for her. This is the first time in many years that some information has emerged about Sabeer,” said sources.The NIA’s investigations in the 2008 case allegedly found that Sabeer had taken five youth — Fayas, Fayis, Abdul Rahim, Mohd. Yasin and Abdul Jabbar to Kashmir in September 2008 and handed them over to an LeT operative. The youths were allegedly being taken to an LeT camp for training but four of them were killed in an encounter with Indian security forces. Abdul Jabbar, the only one to escape, was later arrested by Kerala Police.The killing of the four and the investigations around their presence in Kashmir led investigators to unravel the mystery behind the Bengaluru blasts, which were allegedly executed withLeT funding, with Sabeer allegedly acting as the key Indian conduit in channelling funds and mobilising men for the Pakistan based terror organisation.According to the NIA, he used the passport of a daily wager, ShameerKollamkudyAlikutty, who is still living in Kerala, to escape. The NIA has found an airport departure card, which showed that he left for Dubai on an Air India flight. “In the departure card, the country of residence has been mentioned as the UAE whereas the occupation was written as sales executive,” the NIA says. The fake passport was later found in a hotel on Kish Island in Iran, a few months after Sabeer left.Agencies also suspect that Sabeer’s “escape” was facilitated by the then keyLeT commander for the India region, RehanaliasWalialias Abdul Aziz alias Rashid Abdullah, who has also been linked to the 26 11 Mumbai terror attack. Wali is also been named along with Sabeer in the plot to recruit Kerala youths for terrorism."

False,"Minister of Justice Wijedasa Rajapakshe said there was no intention to incite racism behind his recent statement that several Sri Lankans have gone to Syria to join the Islamic State (IS), Colombo Page reports on November 21. He said he wanted to draw the attention to a dangerous situation that could be risen by hiding the facts and decided to disclose the facts regarding the IS rebels. Justifying his statement the Justice Minister said the even the international media in foreign countries publish the information related to individuals joining the IS in order to suppress the terrorist acts. However, some websites are publishing false news reports and causing damage to the independence of the country s judiciary as well eroding the confidence of the public in the judicial system, the Minister pointed out. The Justice Minister charged that a small number of journalists are using the situation to spread false news reports and create a media mafia. The Minister had informed the Parliament on November 18 that 32 well educated Sri Lankan Muslims of four families have joined the IS in Syria.Earlier, the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka (MCSL) had strongly objected to the statement made by the Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in Parliament regarding the Muslim community. Issuing a statement on November 19, MCSL president N M Ameen had said Minister s statement implies that 32 Muslims have joined the IS recently. We strongly object to this misplaced statement. The facts given by the Honorable Minister were reported in the media more than one year ago when a Sri Lankan combatant died fighting with ISIS. There have been no new reports of any others involved since this was reported last year, he pointed out. It is believed that one family had gone to Syria to provide humanitarian support to the war wounded and refugees. Some of the men are alleged to have joined or forced to join the fighting forces of ISIS. The Muslim community, including the Muslim Council, Jamiathul Ulema and other organizations cooperated with the government in identifying the families to provide the necessary support for the intelligence agencies to investigate. Those who have gone to Syria as quoted by Hon. Rajapakshe include women and children. he said. Ameen said the Minister s statement comes at a very opportune time to certain extremist elements bent on tarnishing the image of the Muslim community for reasons only best known to them. The Muslim community is seriously alarmed about the re emergence of the racist campaign that was carried out by extremist Buddhist monks since the end of the war in 2009. Many youth too have started social media campaigns against the Muslim community. The statements made by the Hon Minster would only help to disturb peace and promote the interests of certain vested interests to destroy our country. We urge the Hon Minister and the Government to investigate this and take appropriate action. We urge the government to take immediate steps to halt all form of extremism and restore peace and harmony for all Sri Lankans, the MCSL President said.Meanwhile, President Maithripala Sirisena gave instructions to the law enforcement agencies and security services to arrest those who incite racism and religious extremism in the country and take legal action against them, Colombo Page reports on November 20.

False,"Secret intelligence reports that have come to light in leaked US diplomatic cables pointed to efforts by “Kashmiri terrorists” to conduct November 26, 2008 Mumbai (26 11) style attacks in Himachal Pradesh and Punjab after the 26 11 attack, reports Indian Express. A classified intelligence report sent out by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in March 2009 details efforts by terrorists to “set off explosions and carry out terrorist attacks” in the two States and speculates that a terror team might have already arrived in Himachal Pradesh to carry out the attack. The detailed reports, drawn up by the US State Department’s Office of Intelligence and Threat Analysis, say that terror groups have been emboldened by the Mumbai attack and are planning attacks on Indian missions abroad and key infrastructure projects in Jammu and Kashmir. “India learned in late March that up to three or more teams of terrorists, at least some of whom are Kashmiris, are planning to set off explosions and carry out terrorist attacks in the states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. At least one terrorist team might already have arrived in Himachal Pradesh,” a cable sent out by Clinton on March 27, 2009 says. “The terrorists allegedly intend to carry out attacks seminal to those in Mumbai,” the report, released by WikiLeaks, adds. The same cable goes on to say that as of early 2009, the Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) remained capable of carrying out attacks on mainland India though there was no information on the location or nature of the attacks. “Indeed, there is little reporting to suggest counter terrorism efforts by the Pakistanis have done anything to encumber LeT’s operational network in South Asia (Himachal Pradesh and Punjab located in northwest India),” it reads. Besides attacks in Punjab and Himachal, LeT was also planning attacks on “high profile infrastructure” in Jammu and Kashmir, the report suggests. “Terrorists may be planning attacks against civilian infrastructure sites in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Possible attack locations include several dams, power stations, and three airports Leh, Kargil, and Jammu Satwari,” the report says. A similar intelligence report sent out by Clinton in December 2008 in the aftermath of the Mumbai attack also says that the LeT was “likely capable” of conducting another attack in India in the coming months. It also reveals that India shared concerns with the US that its missions abroad would be attacked by Pakistan based terror groups. While inputs in many cables point to the frustration in India over the lack of action by Pakistan against terror camps post the Mumbai attack, there is also a reference to intelligence sharing by Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) Chief Shuja Pasha on possible threats against Israeli targets in India."

False,"Intelligence alerts on terrorist threats in Delhi were 50 per cent down over the past five years, Hindustan Times reports on December 11. Experts cautioned that the declining number didn’t mean New Delhi has become less vulnerable to attacks, especially from Pakistan based militant outfits such the Jaish e Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar e Taiba (LeT). The Jaish and Lashkar enjoy patronage from the Pakistani establishment and army, and are involved in this year’s Pathankot air base and Uri army camp attacks in which about two dozen Indian soldiers were killed. Pakistan denies the charge.The Intelligence Bureau (IB) and Research and Analysis Wing (R AW) alerted Delhi Police 306 times about possible terrorist attacks since 2012, which recorded the highest number of warnings at 77. In comparison, only 29 alerts have surfaced till September, 2016 a Delhi Police response to a right to information query revealed. “Broadly, we can divide these inputs into two parts. One is of general nature. Say possibilities of attack during Independence Day and Republic Day. We circulate these inputs to keep our forces on the toes,” a senior Delhi police officer said. He added, “The second type is specific. For instance, X person is coming to Delhi and staying in a particular hotel. We investigate and report back to the agency about the authenticity of the alert. No information is available on the authenticity of each and every alert.”Another aspect attributed to the decreasing alerts is the growing presence of Islamic State (IS) and al Qaeda sympathizers, and home grown militants. Intelligence agencies don’t share alerts in such cases, but take action with the help of local Police. Delhi Police arrested about a dozen militants in 2016; among them six IS sympathisers and two are from the al Qaeda in Indian Subcontinent (AQIS). “None of them came directly from Pakistan. Agencies get information about Pakistan based terrorist through local informers and technical intervention such as call interception, including months of work such as data encryption as ISIS members interact through social media,” an officer said. Such cases go beyond the realm of alert, but invite actionable input that requires direct collaboration between the intelligence agency and police to arrest the militant. “That explains why number of terrorism related alerts is going down, though IS members are getting arrested increasingly,” the officer said."

The information came out that many of the SIM cards being used by nearly 700 million mobile users in the country may have malevolent embedded software, which has put India s security agencies on tenterhooks. This new national security risk has alarmed the MHA and it intends to ask the telecom industry to replace all such imported SIMs in the country with locally manufactured ones at their own cost. According to a Government source, only 30 of the total volumes of SIM cards are imported at present, though even this figure will now be subjected to a formal evaluation of installed capacity. The fear is that the embedded software turns the SIM card into a minicomputer, which can be a cause of abuse. The security agencies are proposing that only blank SIM cards be allowed for import and the personalization process be done entirely by domestic firms. However, since this can only reduce vulnerability of future imports, MHA wants the industry to replace all existing SIMs at its own cost. The MHA also wants the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) to weed out all fake and duplicate IMEI numbers, indicating that its earlier crackdowns have not been entirely successful."

Having gone through the entire action plan, unfortunately, we did not find an answer to this simple and basic question.”India’s position is that while the action plan is “full of prescriptions” to member countries, it is low on what the UN will do in terms of assisting member states in this venture.

False,"The infiltration of militants into Kashmir valley has gone up this year despite Army being on high alert along the Line of Control (LoC) and militants are making desperate attempts to sneak in even after surgical strikes conducted by Special Forces of Army in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) last month, reports Daily Excelsior on October 17. According to MultiAgency Centre (MAC) figures, 83 militants, mostly belonging to LashkareToiba (LeT), have infiltrated into Kashmir this year till August while last year the number was 35 for the whole year. However, a senior security force officer said that it is a conservative estimate and the figure could be higher than official figure as since July 8, after the killing of HizbulMujahideen (HM) ‘commander’, Burhan Wani, the security agencies are not getting accurate picture about recently infiltrated militants. The officer said that some of the recently infiltrated groups are yet to come under Security Forces (SFs) radar. Some of these militants are still in North Kashmir’s forest areas near the LoC while others have managed to reach the hinterland unnoticed. The infiltration attempts are still going on despite the surgical strikes against the militant launch pads in PoK at Dudniyal in Kail, Neelam, Leepa, Bhimber and Tata Pani. At Dudniyal in Kail area, the LeT suffered major damage where lot of their cadre who were planning to infiltrate were killed. Sources said that despite the surgical strikes the militant training camps are still active in PoK with 19 of them most active including those at Skardu, Kel, Karko, Dullu, Titwal, Chakoti, Kotli, Dehri, Barhal Mirpur and Chaprai. In these training camps, the militants are receiving rigorous training besides map reading, global positioning system (GPS) use, weight, weapon and tactical training. They said that over 200 militants are still waiting at launch pads for infiltration before the onset of winter but now they are alert. The militant leaders want to push in more infiltrators this year ahead of winter as security forces achieved major success against militants this year by eliminating over 115 of them so far. Army has intensified its vigil along the LoC and already two Brigades of Army have been sent to LoC in North Kashmir to take on the infiltrated militants and one more Brigade of Army has been sent to South Kashmir after increased militancy in the area. Militants taking advantage of the unrest have recruited locals into militancy and have activated their Over Ground Workers (OGWs) as well.

False,"An Indian terror module pledging allegiance to the Islamic State (IS ISIS) is a reorganized group of the virtually defunct Indian Mujahideen (IM) and Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) elements, recruiting new members to carry out a string of terror strikes across the country, highly placed intelligence sources said, reports The Shillong Times on January 30. This fact came out during the questioning of 14 suspected Islamic State (IS) sympathisers who were arrested last week from 12 places in six cities in a synchronized raid conducted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the sources added. Those inspired by the IS ideology were hooked by Yusuf al Hind who, the Indian security agencies believe, is former IM member Shafi Armar, a resident of Bhatkal in Karnataka. Armar, now believed to be in the Islamic State held area along the border of Iraq and Syria, formed ‘Janood ul Khalifa e Hind’ and recruited Mumbai based 33 year old Mudabbir Mushtaq Shaikh as ‘Amir’ (chief) of the group. Official sources privy to the investigation said that Armar also recruited his brother Sultan and others who had worked for IM and the now banned SIMI. “Apart from former IM and SIMI members, Armar chose those who are basically inspired by the IS ideology. He first recruited his close aides and then inspired them to recruit more supporters,” said an unnamed official. They used social networking sites and made calls through the internet (using VoIP Voice over Internet Protocol) to activate the sleeper cells of IM and SIMI,” the official added.Another intelligence source declining to be identified said that the outfit members were directed to carry out strikes across multiple cities, including Hyderabad in Telangana, Bengaluru, Mangalore and Tumkur in Karnataka, Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh, and Aurangabad and Mumbai in Maharashtra. “They were asked to organise training camps like how to use fire arms before the attack.

The 14 men, allegedly influenced by IS and arrested by the NIA, are also said to have revealed that the 20 year old Uttar Pradesh based Mohammed Aleem was chosen as Naib Amir, the second in command of the group after Mudabbir.

False,"Pakistan s Prime Minister (PM) Nawaz Sharif on September 30, called for an expanded United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) to monitor the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, as part of what he proposed would be a new peace process between the two countries, reports The Times of India. In an address to the United Nations (UN) that was widely anticipated in the subcontinent because of previews in Pakistan that he would present evidence of India fomenting unrest in Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif came up with zilch. Aside from generically saying neighbors should not foment instability in Pakistan (which could apply to several countries) there were no charges, forget any shred of evidence, which Sharif s National Security Advisor (NSA) and other officials had promised to produce. Instead, it was a familiar lament about how Kashmir has been neglected by the UN and resolutions on the issue had not been taken up, although Pakistan stands in violation of most aspects of the resolution such as vacating Occupied Kashmir. Global threat of terrorism cannot be defeated without addressing the underlying causes, Sharif said, repeating an argument that has been largely discredited as validating terrorism. Without naming India, he said some countries were suppressing the rights of self determination in the name of fighting terrorism. Sharif said he had reached out to the Indian leadership when the new dispensation took over in New Delhi last year but things had gone south with the escalation in border tension in recent days. To avert further escalation, he was proposing a new peace with India with steps, including formalising and respecting the 2003 understanding on ceasefire with a ramped up UNMOGIP, an affirmation that neither side will resort to force or threat of use of force, steps to demilitarize Kashmir, and mutual withdrawal from Siachen. Earlier, indirectly accusing India for its instability, Sharif said in his United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) speech, Wisdom dictates that our immediate neighbor refrains from fomenting instability in Pakistan. The two countries should address and resolve causes of tension and take all possible measures to avert further escalation. Countering Sharif s charges, Swarup said, Pakistan s instability arises from its breeding of terrorists. Blaming neighbours is not a solution. Sharif in his speech also suggested a new peace initiative between the two countries. One of the ways to achieve peace, according to him, was to demilitarize Kashmir. Apart from this, he also wanted unconditional and mutual withdrawal from Siachen Glacier, the world s highest battle ground. Swarup seem to have reacted to this in his tweet To de militarize Kashmir is not the answer, to de terrorize Pakistan is. In another tweet, he said Pakistan is not primary victim of terrorism but of its own policies. It is in fact the prime sponsor of terrorism. Separately, Pakistan PM Sharif on September 30, proposed a new four point peace initiative which includes demilitarisation of Kashmir and unconditional withdrawal of forces from Siachen, reports The Times of India. Addressing the UNGA, he also proposed restraint by both countries from use or the threat of use of force under any circumstances and formalisation of the 2003 border ceasefire as part of the formula to ensure peaceful ties between the two nuclear armed neighbours. Sharif suggested four ways in this initiative. I want to use this opportunity today to propose a new peace initiative with India starting with measures that are simplest to implement, he said. Sharif s four points We propose that Pakistan and India formalize and respect the 2003 understanding for a complete ceasefire on the Line of Control in Kashmir. For this purpose, we call for UNMOGIP expansion to monitor the observance of ceasefire. We propose that Pakistan and India reaffirm that they will not resort to the use or the threat of use of force under any circumstances. This is a central element of the UN charter. Steps must be taken to demilitarize Kashmir Agree to unconditional mutual withdrawal from Siachen Glacier, the world s highest battle ground."

False,"A downward trend in the number of overall incidents of violence, which had started in 2010 and continued in the two subsequent years, could not persist in 2013 reported The News on January 5. It took a slight upward curve during the campaign for the 2013 general election and sustained until the year’s end. This was revealed in the Pakistan Security Report 2013, produced and recently released by an Islamabad based research institute Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). According to the PIPS report, militant, nationalist insurgent and violent sectarian groups carried out a total of 1,717 terrorist attacks across Pakistan in 2013, claiming the lives of 2,451 people and causing injuries to another 5,438. As compared to 2012, the number of reported terrorist attacks in Pakistan in 2013 posted a nine per cent increase while the number of people killed and injured in these attacks increased by 19 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively. The major actor of instability in the country in 2013 was the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Despite the killing of some of its top leaders in Drone attacks and also military operations launched by Pakistani Security Forces (SFs), the operational capabilities of the group remained intact. An alliance of numerous militant groups and commanders, TTP proved lethal in 2013 as it carried out 645 terrorist attacks in 50 Districts across the country, claiming the lives of 732 civilians and 425 SFs personnel. A rise in sectarian violence that started in 2011 continued through 2012 towards the end of 2013. While the overall incidents of sectarian violence, including sectarian related attacks and clashes, posted a slight increase in 2013 as compared to 2012, the number of people killed and injured in these incidents significantly increased. The number of suicide attacks across the country rose by 39 per cent, with 46 suicide attacks in 2013 compared to 33 in 2012. As many as 18 (39 per cent) out of the total suicide attacks in 2013 were recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 12 in Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA), 9 in Balochistan, 5 in Sindh and 1 each in Rawalpindi and Azad Kashmir. Of the total, 34 suicide attacks were perpetrated by the TTP and other similar militant groups, 9 were sectarian related mainly carried out by Lashkar e Jhangvi (LeJ) and 1 suicide blast was carried out by nationalist insurgents. Another 2 attacks were carried out in inter militant clashes. US Drone strikes in Pakistan’s tribal areas registered a 31 per cent decrease in 2013 compared to the previous year and fatalities in these attacks also fell by 39 per cent. Out of 31 reported Drone attacks in 2013, as many as 24 struck militants and their hideouts in North Waziristan Agency, in FATA. Five Drone strikes were reported in South Waziristan, and one each in Khyber Agency and Hangu, a settled District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The number of overall cross border attacks and clashes increased in 2013, particularly along Pak India border (including the Line of Control and the working boundary), but the casualties in these attacks decreased. Most of the cross border attacks and clashes (68, or 66 per cent) were reported from Pakistan’s border with India 26 and 9 attacks, respectively, were reported from Pakistan’s borders with Afghanistan and Iran. On the whole, 103 border attacks and clashes were reported from Pakistan’s borders with Afghanistan, India and Iran, which were 30 percent more than such incidents in 2012. As many as 59 Pakistani citizens, including personnel of security forces and civilians lost their lives in these incidents, 82 per cent less than the killings in such incidents in 2012. The incidents of ethno political violence in Pakistan increased by 22 per cent, from 183 in 2012 to 224 in 2013, but the fatalities in these incidents slightly decreased from 288 in 2012 to 283 in 2013. While most incidents of ethno political violence in 2013 were concentrated in Karachi (over 81 per cent), such incidents were reported from a total of 28 districts in all four provinces of Pakistan. It was apparently due to the May 2013 elections that the ethno political violence in the country became more complex with increasing number of political parties becoming either part of it or being targeted in politically motivated targeted killings. Despite a decrease in fatalities in 2013 in the overall incidents of violence, the number of civilians killed in these incidents increased by 16 per cent and of civilians injured by 34 per cent. However, the number of militants killed in 2013 in overall incidents of violence declined by 28 percent. Fatalities among SFs personnel also modestly decreased, by almost two per cent."

Meanwhile, a US Senate committee voted to make economic and security aid to Pakistan conditional on its cooperation in fighting militants. The Senate committee did not specify any amount for economic aid to Pakistan for fiscal 2012, leaving it up to the Obama administration to set the level and notify Congress or provide nothing at all. If the administration wants to provide zero, that d be OK with us, said Republican Senator Mark Kirk, one of the more vocal critics of Pakistan on the panel. The committee did approve USD 1 billion for the Pakistan Counter insurgency Capability Fund, which was created in 2009 to help Pakistan s military develop counter insurgency capabilities to fight Islamist militants within its borders. But the committee voted to make this aid, as well as any economic aid that is provided, conditional on Pakistan s cooperating with Washington against several militant groups.

It will have to be reconciled with the House of Representatives, where lawmakers in one subcommittee have voted similar restrictions. Pakistan also gets US military aid via the Pentagon budget. But Washington is already withholding USD 800 million of that aid this year as ties have come under mounting strain. Washington has allocated about USD 20 billion for Pakistan over the last decade. In fiscal 2010, Congress approved USD 1.7 billion for economic aid for Pakistan, and USD 2.7 billion in security aid, the Congressional Research Service says."

False,"Investigations into the Indian module of Islamic State (IS) inspired Junood al Khalifa e Hind, is leading a trail to Dubai, dnaindia.com reports on April 29. Bhatkal resident Ismail Abdul Rauf’s interrogation has given leads to investigators on missing links that could be a part of the large puzzle, including the alleged Islamic State (IS) fighter Shafi Armar alias Yousuf al Hindi, and how he purportedly funded to raise an Indian affiliated jihadi group through Dubai.Known as the centre of money laundering or hawala operations, Dubai, along with other countries in the Gulf region, houses a large Indian diaspora. Importantly, various armed groups, including the IS, in the ongoing conflict in Syria are funded through a network of private donations, collected from sheikhs, tribal leaders, influential ulemas and Arab diaspora based in Gulf countries. These two factors could be a starting point in unraveling the funding of Junood al Khalifa e Hind group outside the Indian territory by the Indians living in Gulf.Rauf had earlier travelled to Dubai 10 months ago to work as a labourer and came into contact with another Bhatkal resident, Ismail Nanda. During the time of their acquaintance, Nanda asked Rauf if he knew any hawala operators in Dubai and the latter gave contact of an operator, Abdullah Umaid. Officials investigating the case said Rauf was later contacted by Nanda and asked to check if Nadeem (code name for Sheikh’s hawala transaction) got the money. Rauf did not know who Mudabbir Sheikh was but it is believed that Nanda used the hawala operator in Dubai, suggested by Rauf, to make the transaction. Rauf was earlier a suspect in the case, but National Investigation Agency (NIA) has now made him a witness and is verifying the information provided by him. The agency is also making use of the mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) with Dubai to dig deep into Nanda s identity and find if he facilitated the hawala transactions to India at the behest of al Hindi or any other IS leader. If substantiated, it will take the investigation closer to proving that al Hindi used the IS group’s funds collected illegally by smuggling and selling oil, antiquities, collecting taxes from population living in its territory, ransom and selling Yezidi women as slaves among other methods to raise a module in India."
