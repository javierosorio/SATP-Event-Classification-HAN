False,"The United States (US) cannot reassure Pakistan against any Indian threat if it fails to commit itself towards working against anti India terrorist groups operating within its territory, two US experts on South Asian issues have told American lawmakers, reports The Economic Times on February 27. George Perkovich, vice president for Studies Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said during a Congressional hearing on February 25, If Pakistan can t commit itself to working against the terrorists that have operated in India, then there s not much we can do to reassure them, there s probably not much we should do to reassure them, because that really is a problem. Responding to questions from lawmakers, Perkovich said the good news is India has no desires for any Pakistani territory or anything in Pakistan. So threat from India is only in response to Pakistani aggression in India or terrorism in India, he said. Testifying before the same committee, Ashley Tellis from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said while there was much enthusiasm in the Pakistan Army to take action against those terrorist groups that they perceive is a threat to Pakistan, the same can t be said about anti India terrorist groups. He said the question was whether Pakistanis will not extend this effort to groups that do not directly threaten Pakistan, but threaten others like Afghanistan, US forces in Afghanistan and India. I think we would declare victory only when Pakistanis begin to think of terrorism in a sort of broader context, and begin to focus their attention on all terrorist groups, and not pick and choose between groups that support their interests, Tellis said."

Good terrorists are the ones that attack your neighbours; bad terrorists are the ones who attack you. This type of approach is enormously short sighted. The blowback is going to be bad. Terrorism will bite like a snake whoever feeds it, he added. Terrorism will bite probably like a snake. States need to have a common perspective, he warned. Ghani also said the threat of terrorism is not a passing threat, and that terrorist organisations change very rapidly, even if their objectives remain the same.He also categorically hit out at those using religion to justify terrorist acts, saying Islam does not condone terrorism. A tiny minority cannot be allowed to hijack a civilization and a religion. There is no terrorism in the past 160 years except for adherence, practitioners from every civilization that we take. So, there is no reason to demonize a certain civilization. But on the other hand, members of that community have an obligation to speak truth to violence, Ghani said. It is unacceptable to speak in the name of Islam. Islam does not allow for terrorism. Terrorism must be condemned and we must stand together to contain it. Extremism cannot be permitted a platform. This is denial of everything that we stand for, and everything that civilization has stood for, he added.He also stressed that Afghanistan does not allow terrorists to launch attacks from its soil, despite the fact that it is under attack.Ghani said that south Asia is reeling under two wars — one in Afghanistan which is not a civil war and the other in Pakistan. However, he said, the war in Pakistan is not being covered adequately by the media. Around 2,700 (Pakistani) forces moved to the north western province and also Balochistan; this violence needs to be covered (by media) as people need to talk about it to address it, Ghani said while answering questions. However, to a specific question on whether he would support the independence movement in Balochistan, he said his country and his government do not interfere in the internal affairs of any country. We respect international norms, Ghani said even as he maintained that if people in these regions are not happy, there is a constitutional framework within Pakistan and that should be able to address the issue. However, in a veiled attack on Pakistan s use of force, he said Forces do not keep people together, rights and connectivity do. Ghani also said, Those who block us will be blocked in what was a reference to Pakistan blocking transit of goods from India to Afghanistan. Ghani has threatened to block Pakistan s acess to Central Asia through Afghanistan.

Brennan, three days after Barack Obama was elected US President in November 2008, wrote to him in a position cum strategy paper that Pakistan uses the Taliban to counter India in Afghanistan. Pakistan s desire to counter India s growing influence in Afghanistan and concerns about US long term commitments to Afghanistan increase Pakistan s interest in hedging its bets by ensuring that it will be able to have a working relationship with the Taliban to balance Indian and Iranian interests if the US withdraws, Brennan wrote on November 7, 2008.

The time has come, when the international community needs to address the plethora of human rights concerns in Pakistan because its impact has moved beyond the county s domestic problem and has begun to affect the region and the world at large”, the statement said."
